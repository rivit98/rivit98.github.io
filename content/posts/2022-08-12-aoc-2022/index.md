As a programmer, it's important to constantly challenge yourself and learn new things. One way to do this is by tackling a new programming language. Recently, I decided to take on the challenge of learning Rust by doing [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). It is an annual programming challenge that consists of a series of small coding puzzles released daily during the month of December. It's a great way to practice your skills and learn new techniques, and it's a lot of fun (sometimes it is not true). 

So far, my experience with Rust has been really positive. The language has a steep learning curve, but the rewards are well worth it. The documentation and community support are excellent, and there are plenty of resources available to help you get started. I've found that working on the puzzles has helped me understand the concepts and features of Rust better than I would have by just reading the documentation.
